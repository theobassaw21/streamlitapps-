### ðŸŒ± Smart Agri-Advisor

Helping Farmers Make Smarter Decisions.

#### Features
- Simple, clean UI optimized for phones and desktops
- Select crop and region, then tap a big "Get Forecast" button
- Price chart shows past data and a short-term forecast (next ~3 weeks)
- Plain-language advisory to help decide when to sell

#### Tech
- Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Altair

#### Run locally
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

#### Deploy to Heroku
1. Ensure you have a Heroku account and the Heroku CLI installed.
2. Login and create an app:
```bash
heroku login
heroku create smart-agri-advisor
```
3. Push the code:
```bash
git init
heroku git:remote -a smart-agri-advisor
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Smart Agri-Advisor"
git push heroku HEAD:main
```
4. Open the app:
```bash
heroku open
```

This repo includes `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` so Heroku runs Streamlit bound to `$PORT`.

#### Notes
- This app uses simple synthetic data and a linear trend to forecast short-term prices. Treat results as guidance only.
